# cdecimal
Extension to python decimal module that can handle complex number calculations.

To Do List:
- find better/faster calculation methods for pi, sin, cos, atan, sinh, cosh that work for arbitrary precision if they exist
- find a way to implement zeta function
- look for other things that might be convenient to implement on a complex number
- move all the hard calculation to C maybe?
